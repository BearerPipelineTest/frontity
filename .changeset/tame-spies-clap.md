Add support for 30x Redirections.

1. Redirections can be stored in the backend server, which will be checked according to different configurations:

   - Each time a link is fetched.
   - When the API returns a 404.
   - When the link belongs to a certain set of URLs (configured using a regexp).

   This configuration is stored in `state.source.redirections`.

   The redirection information will be stored in `state.source.data` similar to what happens for 4xx and 5xx errors.

2. Redirections can be added to Frontity by populating `state.source.data` directly or using a handler.
