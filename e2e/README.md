# E2E Tests

The e2e tests allow you to run tests using a real browser. They start both a Frontity server and a WordPress server, along with a browser.

## Installation

- Install Docker on your computer.
- Install the dependencies of the e2e tests: `cd e2e && npm install`.

## Usage

### Running the tests

Use the `node e2e.js` CLI:

```sh
cd e2e && node e2e.js
```

This command will:

- Start a WordPress instance in the 8080 port.
- Start a Frontity project in the 3001 port.
- Run the e2e tests using Cypress.

### Adding new tests

1. Create a Frontity site in `e2e/project/frontity.settings.js`.

1. If you need a package, you can create one in the `e2e/packages` folder. Remember to add it to the `e2e/project/package.json` and run `npm install` again from the root (`/`) so `lerna` can link the new package.

1. Create a `my-tests.spec.js` file in either:

   - The `e2e/integration/frontity-01` folder if they don't require a WordPress instance.
   - The `e2e/integration/wordpress-01` folder if they require a WordPress instance.

_In the future we may add other `frontity-xx` or `wordpress-xx` folders to be able to run tests in parallel in the CI._

Tests are written using the Cypress API. Please refer to their documentation for reference: https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress.html#Writing-tests

### Installing WordPress plugins

You can use a Cypress task to install plugins in your spec file.

```js
before(() => {
  cy.task("installPlugin", { name: "some-wp-plugin" });
});
```

By default it will install the last stable version. If you want to test a specific version, you can do so using `version`:

```js
before(() => {
  cy.task("installPlugin", { name: "some-wp-plugin", version: "12.6" });
});
```

Internally, it uses the [WP CLI to install](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/plugin/install/) the plugins.

**It does not activate the plugin after installation.** If you want to activate the plugin, login in WordPress and then export the database, as explained in the "Configuring WordPress Database" section below.

If you install a WordPress plugin, it is required that you run the `removeAllPlugins` task in the `after` of your spec, like:

```js
after(() => {
  cy.task("removeAllPlugins");
});
```

### Configuring WordPress Database

Once WordPress has started, you can access it in `http://localhost:8080`.

If you need to modify the database, you can log in on `http://localhost:8080/wp-admin` with the user name `admin` and the password `password`.

After you've done your modifications, export the database to the `e2e/wp-data` folder using:

```sh
node export-db.js ./wp-data/my-test-suite/my-database.sql
```

You can replace the database in your spec file using a Cypress task:

```js
before(() => {
  cy.task("loadDatabase", {
    path: "./wp-data/my-test-suite/my-database.sql",
  });
});
```

And commit the new database along with your new tests.

If you replace the database, it is required that you run the `resetDatabase` task in the `after` of your spec, like:

```js
after(() => {
  cy.task("removeAllPlugins");
  cy.task("resetDatabase");
});
```

If you need to reset the database while you're working, you can do so with the `node reset-db.js` command.

### Uploading files to WordPress

If you need to, you can also upload files, which will end up on the `e2e/data/uploads` folder. Those files are currently shared among all the tests, although we may change that in the future.

## CLI

The `node e2e.js` script is a CLI that supports multiple arguments for running the e2e tests in different configurations.

The defaults correspond to the most common configuration when working locally, so running just `node e2e.js` will be enough to start working locally most of the time.

## Running the tests in BrowserStack

BrowserStack can be used to run the tests in the cloud. If you want to do that, create a `.env` file with your BrowserStack username and access key, and then use `node e2e.js --cypress browserstack` to start.

By default, it will run the tests in the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox and Edge in Windows 10.

You can create your own `browserstack.json` file and use `--browserstack-config my-browserstack.json` to use it.

By default it will run BrowserStack Local with "Cypress-Local" as the local identifier, but you can turn it off by using `--browserstack-local off`.

### `--wp`: string

The WordPress version that will be used in the Docker container. For example, `--wp 5.5`.

You can use `off` to prevent WordPress from running.

WordPress won't load in these situations:

- `--wp` is `off`.
- `--cypress` is `browserstack`.
- `--suite` is not `all` or it doesn't start with `wordpress`.

Default: `latest`

### `--prod`: boolean

If Frontity runs in production mode (`npx frontity build && npx frontity server`) or in development mode (`npx frontity dev`).

Default: `false`

### `--target`: "es5" | "module" | "both"

The Frontity `target` that will be used.

Default: `both`

### `--cypress`: "open" | "run" | "browserstack" | "off"

Whether to run Cypress or not, and if it does, whether to run it in "open" mode, "run" mode, or on the BrowserStack cloud.

_The BrowserStack cloud requires the setup of a `.env` file with the username and access key. Please check the `.env-example` file._

Default: `open`

### `--browser`: "chrome" | "firefox" |Â "edge"

The browser used to run the tests. Only browsers supported by Cypress and installed in the system are possible.

Default: `chrome`

### `--suite`: "all" | string

The tests suite to run. `all` will run all the suites. Each suite represents a different folder in the `e2e/integrations` folder. For example `--suite wordpress-01` will only run the specs found in the `e2e/integrations/wordpress-01` folder.

Default: `all`.

### `--inspect`: boolean

If present, it will start the Frontity dev server using `node --inspect`.

Default: `false`.

### `--spec`: string

The tests spec to run. This should be the file name spec. For example if you want to run a single spec file, you should pass the name without the `.spec.js` suffix, like so:

```sh
# This will run only the script.spec.js file in the `./integrations` folder
node e2e.js --spec script
```

_It doesn't affect if Cypress is run in `"open"` mode._

Default: `null`.

### `--browserstack-config`: string

The BrowserStack configuration file. For example:

```sh
node e2e.js --browserstack-config browserstack.custom.json
```

Default: `browserstack.json`.

### `--browserstack-local`: string

The local identifier of the BrowserStack Local connection.

BrowserStack Local only runs if `--cypress` is `browserstack`. For example:

```sh
node e2e.js --cypress browserstack --browserstack-local MyLocalMachine
```

If you don't want to start BrowserStack Local, use:

```sh
node e2e.js --cypress browserstack --browserstack-local off
```

Default: `Cypress-Local`.
