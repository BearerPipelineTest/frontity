# `@frontity/google-ad-manager`

The Google Ad Manager package enables Frontity to integrate with Google Ad Manager. It allows you to add ads as **fills** in `frontity.settings.js` so that they will appear in a specific **slot** defined in your theme. (see [Slot and Fill](https://api.frontity.org/frontity-packages/core-package/frontity#slot))

## Installation

Add the `google-ad-manager` package to your project:

```bash
npm i @frontity/google-ad-manager
```

## Settings

This package can be included in your `frontity.settings.js` file as one of the packages that will be part of your Frontity project.

The [namespace](https://docs.frontity.org/learning-frontity/namespaces) for this package is **`googleAdManager`**. The object should be added to `state.fills`.

Each fill in the **`googleAdManager`** namespace is an object which should be assigned to an arbitrarily named key. The structure should be as follows:

```js
export default {
  packages: [
    {
      name: "@frontity/google-ad-manager",
      state: {
        fills: {
          googleAdManager: {
            arbitrary_fill_name: {
              // Object properties
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

## Usage

The recommended usage of this component is as detailed above using the Slot and Fill pattern. The configuration of the fill(s) is done in the `state.fills.googleAdManager` namespace in `frontity.settings.js`.

However, the Ad component is exposed in libraries and so you can get the `GooglePublisherTag` component from libraries and render it in any place.

```jsx
const Component = ({ libraries }) => {
¬†¬†const MyAd = libraries.fills.googleAdManager.GooglePublisherTag;

	Return (
	¬†¬†<MyAd
        unit=‚Äù/unit/234‚Äù
	¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†size="[300, 600]"
		/>
	)
}

Export connect(Component);
```
