# `@frontity/google-ad-manager`

The Google Ad Manager package enables Frontity to integrate with Google Ad Manager. It allows you to add ads as **fills** in `frontity.settings.js` so that they will appear in a specific **slot** defined in your theme. (see [Slot and Fill](https://api.frontity.org/frontity-packages/core-package/frontity#slot))

## Installation

Add the `google-ad-manager` package to your project:

```bash
npm i @frontity/google-ad-manager
```

## Usage

The recommended usage of this component is using the Slot and Fill pattern. The configuration of the fill(s) is done in the `state.fills.googleAdManager` namespace in `frontity.settings.js`.

However, the Ad component is exposed in libraries and so you can get the `GooglePublisherTag` component from libraries and render it in any place.

> More information about how to use the google-ad-manager package can be found in the [docs](https://api.frontity.org/frontity-packages/features-packages/google-ad-manager.md).
